# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#

      about_title: "Our Philosophy"
      about_text: "The Dora Radino properties are situated on the rolling hills of the Basilicata region. The volcanic soil lends itself particularly well for the farming of olive trees.
      The Dora Radino family has always been at the fore front in the production of premium quality organic olive oil. When Mrs Dora Radino decided to take over the direct management of the family farmland in the 1980s, the aim she had in mind was to enrich traditional approaches to quality by introducing organic techniques.
      We are above all farmers, bound to our soil, our plants and the people who grow them and look after them
      A few years ago we started retailing our organic olive oil ourselves as we wanted to offer a reasonably-priced top-quality product that is traceable from tree to table under the control of our own farm."
